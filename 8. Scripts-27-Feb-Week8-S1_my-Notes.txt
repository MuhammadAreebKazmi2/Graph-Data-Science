// If I have all links connected with my neighbors at a specific node 
// \-> this means we form a complete graph with my neighbors 

// The coefficient query in file 7 holds the Clustering Coefficient

// cc(i) = L / ((ki(ki-1)) / 2)
// where cc = Clustering Coeff
// ki is the degree of nodes
// L is the number of links
// i is the node

// Average path length checks the start<>end so the start end are not similar (loop)
