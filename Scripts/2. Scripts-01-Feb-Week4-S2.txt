CREATE

// These are all comments
MERGE creates new nodes if there does not exist a relation b/w 2 persons
This makes it redundant since 2 duplicate nodes
What we do now?
- Match the two nodes
- Then Merge
e.g.
MATCH P
MATCH n
MERGE (p)-[:KNOWS]->(n) // Instead of MERGE if we return, nothing happens since MATCH MATCH are AND conditions

// if already knows relationship exists, and we merge, nothing happens

// if we do MERGE MERGE, instead of match match
// the nodes will be created in case they were not there


UPDATE
for SET and array properties
// we can provide labels using SET as well
We can assign more than 1 labels to a node
// a person can be an employee as well


REMOVE 
can be used to remove the properties of a label or a label itself
We can also SET the property of a label as NULL to remove the property

DELETE
can be used to delete either the node or the relationship 

// IF a node has relationships, we cannot DELETE the node directly
in order to do that, delete the node with relationships


PRACTICE
// 1
CREATE (p:Person {name:'Daniel Kaluuya'})

// 2
MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Daniel Kaluuya'})
MERGE (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'})
MERGE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m)

// verified it by
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = "Get Out"
RETURN *


MORE PRACTICE
// 1 Adding actors in labe
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
SET p: Actor
RETURN p

// 2 Adding directors in label for directors
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]-(m:Movie)
SET p: DIRECTOR
RETURN p
